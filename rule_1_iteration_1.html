    <h1>Rule 1.1</h1>
    <h2>The New Colossus</h2>
    <h3>by Emma Lazarus</h3>
    <br />
   <p> Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, </p>
<p>With conquering limbs astride from land to land;</p>
<p>Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand</p>
<p>A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame</p>
<p>Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name</p>
<p>Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand</p>
<p>Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command</p>
<p>The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.</p>
<p><span class="voice">“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” </span>cries she </p>
<p>With silent lips. <span class="voice">“Give me your tired, your poor,</span></p>
<p><span class="voice">Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,</span></p>
<p><span class="voice">The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.</span></p>
<p><span class="voice">Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,</span></p>
<p><span class="voice">I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”</span></p>
